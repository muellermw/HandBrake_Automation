# HandBrake_Automation
Linux wrapper script to automate HandBrake while compressing movies -- Use the latest HandBrakeCLI available on Linux

The "Base" script is meant to run periodically in a place you dump files to be compressed.
The "Portable" version is meant to be a command used to recursively scan directories for valid video files.

You will probably want to edit the scripts to fit your needs and enviroment. Hopefully this helps somebody!
